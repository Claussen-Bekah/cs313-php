        <h1>BEKAH CLAUSSEN</h1>
        <p>I'm Bekah Claussen. Since I can talk about anything I want and I don't want to discuss personal information,
            I will say that right now my biggest passion is preventing Trump from being reelected. He is a liar, and a
            cheat,
            and every day he violates the Constitution <a
                href="https://www.theusconstitution.org/blog/president-trump-mocking-the-constitution/"
                target="_blank">(this is not exaggeration)</a>. He is a very real threat to our democracy. Not electing
            him goes beyond partisan politics. We can vote out Biden in four years if we want, but at least we will
            still have a democracy. <a href="https://secure.anedot.com/the-lincoln-project/donate" target="_blank">Go
                here</a> to donate to prevent Trump's reelection.
